# Ansible host

This folder provides a Vagrant VM with ansible preconfigured
for this course.

## Prerequisites

The following needs to be installed:

* [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 
* [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)


# Get started

To get started with the Ansible provisioned host:

```bash
cd <project>/ansible-host
vagrant up
```

This can take a while as it will now create an Ubuntu VM with
ansible and ssh preconfigured
